Simple game written in Java and using the Java Swing Library 

The goal of Minesweeper is to find on all the squares without a mine in the shortest possible time by clicking on it. When you click on a square, it either reveals a mine in which case you lose or a number that tells you the number of adjacent squares with a mine. 

The goal of this project is to help me practise object-oriented programming concept, implementing a graphical user interface 
and using different design patterns.  

To do list: 
- finish the MineCountLabel class
- implement the win condition - right now the game stop where you win or lose
- finish the GUI component
- add comment where appropriate
- add in static/final keyword where possible
- insert assert statement where appropriate to ensure that the input to a function is valid
- refactor
