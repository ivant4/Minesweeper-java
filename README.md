Simple game written in Java and using the Java Swing Library 

The goal of Minesweeper is to find on all the squares without a mine in the shortest possible time by clicking on it. When you click on a square, it either reveals a mine in which case you lose or a number that tells you the number of adjacent squares with a mine. 

The goal of this project is to help me practise object-oriented programming concept, implementing a graphical user interface 
and using different design patterns.
